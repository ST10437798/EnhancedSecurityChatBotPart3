# EnhancedSecurityChatBotPart3
Enhanced Cybersecurity Chatbot & Task ManagerThis is a desktop application built with WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) that serves as an interactive cybersecurity chatbot and a personal task manager. It provides users with cybersecurity advice, allows them to manage tasks, test their knowledge with a quiz, and track their interactions via an activity log.‚ú® FeaturesInteractive Chatbot: Engages users with predefined responses to cybersecurity queries, general greetings, and sentiment-aware replies.Intelligent Task Management:Add, complete, and delete cybersecurity-related tasks.Set reminders for tasks using natural language (e.g., "remind me to update password tomorrow").View all pending and completed tasks.Automated reminders for overdue tasks.Cybersecurity Quiz Game: Test your knowledge with a multiple-choice or true/false quiz.Activity Logging: Keeps a running log of user inputs and chatbot responses, visible upon request.Startup ASCII Art: Displays custom ASCII art from your Downloads folder upon application launch, adding a personal touch.Responsive UI: Designed with WPF controls for a clean and interactive desktop experience.üíª Technologies UsedC#: The primary programming language for application logic.WPF (.NET): Framework for building the rich desktop user interface.LINQ: Used for querying and manipulating collections (e.g., in task management and quiz question selection).Regular Expressions (System.Text.RegularExpressions): For simulating Natural Language Processing (NLP) to parse task commands from user input.System.IO: For file operations, specifically to read the ASCII art.System.Windows.Threading.DispatcherTimer: For handling background reminders without blocking the UI thread.üöÄ Getting StartedTo get this application up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:PrerequisitesVisual Studio (2019 or later recommended) with .NET Desktop Development workload installed..NET (latest version is usually fine, compatible with .NET Core 3.1+ or .NET Framework 4.7.2+).SetupClone the Repository (or create a new WPF project):If you're starting from scratch, create a new "WPF Application" project in Visual Studio.Replace MainWindow.xaml.cs:Open MainWindow.xaml.cs in your project and replace its entire content with the code provided below:// (Content of the latest `main_window_cs` immersive artifact goes here)
// Make sure to copy the complete code from the previous interaction.
// This includes all using statements, class definitions, and method implementations.
// As a reminder, the ASCII art path is now dynamic:
// private static readonly string AsciiArtFilePath = Path.Combine(Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.UserProfile), "Downloads", "ascii-art.txt");
Replace MainWindow.xaml:Open MainWindow.xaml and replace its entire content with the provided XAML structure. This ensures all UI elements have the correct x:Name attributes and basic styles needed by the C# code.<!-- (Content of the latest `main_window_xaml` immersive artifact goes here) -->
<!-- This includes the <Window> root element, Grid definitions, and all controls with x:Name attributes. -->
Add ASCII Art File:Create a plain text file named ascii-art.txt.Paste your desired ASCII art into this file.Save this file directly into your user's Downloads folder. (e.g., C:\Users\YourUserName\Downloads\ascii-art.txt). The application will dynamically find it there.Build the Project:In Visual Studio, go to Build > Clean Solution, then Build > Rebuild Solution. This will compile the updated code.Run the Application:Press F5 or click the "Start" button in Visual Studio to run the application.üõ†Ô∏è How to UseChat: Type your questions in the input box at the bottom and press Enter or click "Send".Task Management (Chat):Add a task to [description] (e.g., "Add a task to backup files")Remind me to [task] tomorrow or Remind me to [task] in 3 days or Remind me to [task] on 2025-07-01Show tasks or List my tasks or View tasksMark task completed [Task Title]Delete task [Task Title]Task Management (GUI): Use the dedicated "Task Manager" section on the right to add tasks, set reminders using the date picker, and view/manage existing tasks.Cybersecurity Quiz: Type Start Quiz in the chat to begin. Follow the prompts and type your answers.Activity Log: Type Show activity log or What have you done for me? in the chat to see recent chatbot activities.üí° Future EnhancementsPersistence: Implement saving/loading tasks and activity log to a file (e.g., JSON, XML) so data persists across sessions.More Advanced NLP: Integrate a proper NLP library for more complex command understanding and general conversation.Notifications: Implement toast notifications for reminders.User Profiles: Allow multiple users to have their own tasks and quiz scores.Expanded Knowledge Base: Add more quiz questions and keyword/topic responses.Voice Input/Output: Integrate speech recognition and text-to-speech for hands-free interaction.
